Mixed algorythm is the same as Evolution with one exception
instead of making one crosover it makes first one and with Hill Climbing
it creates neighbors form first crossover and find the cheaper one
after 10 iteration of hill climbing it start to make new population by muteting the cheaper neighbor



main:
    chose the input file
    open files
    enter numbers of iterations (x)
    enter size of population (y)
    rewrite everthing from input.txt to a array
    #create initial population
    iterations x-times:
        #find parents in population
        #create crossover from parents
        Hill Climbing crossover (10 iterations) (the crossover is a initial solution to hillclimbing)
            make neighbor by randomising one diferent point than in last solution
            if neighbor is cheaper than solution
                solution becomes the cheaper neighbor
        #make new population by mutating crossover (crossover = the cheapest neighbor from Hill Climbing)
    show cheapest entity from last population
    
#create initial population
    it makes y-entities with random K-points by
        randomises k points that dont repeate
        find all conections of those points
        if in entity is a single pint not conected to any other
            try again making initial entity

#find parents in population
    it finds two cheapest entities from population

#create crossover from parents
    if parents similarity is more than 75% (if parents have more than 75% points the same)
        crossover have points from the cheaper parents
    else if parents are not so similar
        creates a array of points from two parents
        crossover have randomise k-points from this array

#make new population by mutating crossover
    makes y-entities in population again by
        coping all points from crossover to entitys
        randomise one diferent point to "mutate" this entity


like in Hill Climbing and Evolution it uses the same functions
there are several more functions like
    print entity which just prints the entity
    entity value which just calculates the value of entity by summing the cost of each edges that conect every point in that entity
    id of those two points connect which just searches in file id of conection that conect point a and b
    checkers like:
        is there a single point which cheks if in the entity is a point not conected to the rest by checking if there is at leats conection to at least one other point in entity
        is the point already in entity which cheks if there might be in solution already the same point
