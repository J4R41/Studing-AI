#main:
    chose the input file
    open files
    enter numbers of iterations
    rewrite everthing from input.txt to a array
    #create initial solution
    iterations x-times:
        #create neighbor
        if neighbor is cheaper than solution
            the solution becoes the cheaper neighbor
    show solution

#create initial solution:
    randomises k points that dont repeate
    find all conections of those points
    if in solution is a single pint not conected to any other
        try again making initial solution

#create neighbor:
    creates entity the same way the initial solution but instead randomising all points it randomise one point and the rest are copy from the solution

there are several more functions like
    print neighbor or print solution which just prints the neighbor or solution
    solution value or neighbor value which just calculates the value of entity by summing the cost of each edges that conect every point in that entity
    id of those two points connect which just searczes in file a id of conection that conect point a and b
    checkers like:
        is there a single point which chekes if in the solution or neighbor is a point not conected to the rest by checking if there is at leats conection to at least one other point in entity
        is the point already in entity which cheks if there might be in solution already the same point
